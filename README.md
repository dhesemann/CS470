# CS470 Full Stack Development II

In this class we explored options for migrating a full stack application to the cloud.
We migrated a complete application to the cloud using both Docker (with Node.js, Angular and MongoDB) and AWS cloud services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB).
Project One was the complete application built using AWS (and availbale by accessing AWS account).
Project Two was a presentation on cloud development (Link in the reflection).
